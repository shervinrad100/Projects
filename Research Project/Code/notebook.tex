\subsubsection{Mathematical context}\label{mathematical-context}

As discussed previously, we aimed to forecast the series using ARIMA
models via a Box-Jenkins approach:

\[ y_{t} =\mu + \alpha_1 y_{t-1} + \ldots + \alpha_p y_{t-p} + \theta_1 \epsilon_1 + \ldots + \theta_q \epsilon_{t-q}  \]

Where \(\mu\) is the drift, \(\alpha\) is \(AR(p)\) and \(\theta\) is
the \(MA(q)\) constants to be estimated. The \(AR(p)\) and the \(MA(q)\)
models must follow stationarity.

The partial autocorrelation function (PACF, \(\phi\)) is the
autocorrelation function (ACF, \(\rho\)), minus the common correlations
between the lags. For example: \(PACF(lag=2)=\)
\(ACF(lag=2)-Corr(X_{t-1})\). This allows us to evaluate the
autoregressive order by observing the significance of the lags. Using
Yule-Walker equations, the matrix for the constnats can simultaneously
be calculated by:

\[ \boldsymbol{\gamma} = \boldsymbol{\Gamma} \boldsymbol{\alpha} \]
where \(\boldsymbol{\gamma}=[\gamma_1, \ldots, \gamma_h]^T\) and
\(\Gamma_{ij}=\gamma_{i-j}\). Numerically, \(\boldsymbol{\gamma}\) is
evaluated as:
\[\widehat{\gamma}_h = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n-h} (x_{j+h} - \overline{x})(x_j - \overline{x})\]
and the coeeficients can be found by inversing \(\boldsymbol{\Gamma}\).

After fitting the \(AR(p)\), the \(\boldsymbol{\theta}\) coefficients
are also evaluated using the autocovariance function (ACVF). Given that
the model is well assumed and the residuals, \(e\), are white noise, the
ACVF can be equated to:

\[ \gamma_h = \sigma^2 \sum_{k=|h|}^{q}(-\theta_{k-|h|})(-\theta_k)\]
And the white noise variance is given by:
\[\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{T-p} \sum_{i=p+1}^{T} e_i^2\] The system of \(p\)
and \(q\) set of equations can be solved with zero degrees of freedom
for all model parameters.

    \subsubsection{Seasonality and
differencing}\label{seasonality-and-differencing}

\subparagraph{Google}\label{google}

We analysed and tested the data for stationarity and normality. The
autocorrelation function (ACF) of "Google Trends" data confirmed
seasonality. Each spike is at a lag multiple of 12, indicating
seasonality for monthly data. The data was also parsed and monthly data
was concatenated over the 9 years to show clear increase in mean and
volatility of searches in the months of November and December.

    \begin{figure}

\end{figure}

    \begin{figure}

\caption{image.png}
\end{figure}

    Thus, google data has been log transformed to normalise the variance,
seasonally differenced (D=12) and tested for unit root using Augmented
Dickey Fuller (ADF) test. The data was not yet stationary, so it was
differenced once more.

Here an issue arose: ADF resulted in type 1 errors, rejecting the null
hypothesis and declaring that there is no unit root present. However, it
was later observed that the SARIMAX (seasonal ARIMA) model in
statsmodels package was unable to carry out the forecast as it observed
non-stationarity of the data. \textbf{The issue will be looked into but
an assumption is that the method used for evaluating the ARIMA
coefficients takes into consideration too many lags. Accordign to Enders
2014 {[}XXX{]} given a sample size of T, it is suggested to consider T/4
lags of the PACF. }

    \begin{figure}

\caption{image.png}
\end{figure}

    \subparagraph{SP500}\label{sp500}

Once again the data was tested. The square of the returns showed
volitility of some significance in some years within the given period
and was therefore log transformed. The first difference of the data
resulted in ADF test statistics of -11.89 (Critical values for 5\%
significance is -2.88) which is highly suspicious. It was once again
discovered that the ADF had resulted in a type 1 error and rejected the
null falsely. Hence, the second difference of the data was taken and the
results are as shown.

    \subsubsection{Forecasting}\label{forecasting}

The data were first forecasted individually and then using a Vector Auto
Regressive Moving Average (VARMAX).

\subparagraph{SP500}\label{sp500}

The ACF and PACF showed a strting model of ARIMAX(3,2,1). 25 models were
then iterated with \(1<p<5\) and \(1<q<5\) and the Akaike, Bayesian (aka
Schwarz) and Hannan-Quinn information criteria (AIC, BIC/SIC, HQIC) was
minimised. AIC recommended the order (2,2,1) and BIC and HQIC both
showed fit of order (1,2,1) to be the best fit model.

    The lagged SP500 suggests that the data is not fully utilised and the
plot of the residuals shows that the model has been ineffective; since
there is clear serial correlation and non-stationarity:

\end{figure}

This can be due to omitted variables. This would therefore be a good
reason for applying a VARMAX which would take into account the
co-linearity of google trends data with SP500.

    \subparagraph{Cross-correlation}\label{cross-correlation}

The cross-correlation function was applied to the second order log
differenced data (after detrending the google data), by lagging the
following:

\[r_{xy} = \frac{\sum((x_i - \overline{x})(y_i-\overline{y})))}{\sqrt{\sum(x_i - \overline{x})^2\sum(y_i-\overline{y})^2}}\]

\begin{figure}

\caption{image.png}
\end{figure}

    The VAR was iterated over \(1<p<5\) and \(1<q<5\) and for each the data
was shifted and then the information criteria was calculated. Even
though the cross correlation showed that google has a half a step
predictability, this would only be useful if we had more data points at
higher frequency. The VAR was iterated over a range of shifts in the GGL
data to evaluate the model fit. All test results show an improvement
when the google data is not shifted.

\toprule
shift & -AIC & -BIC\tabularnewline

The plot residuals also show satisfactory conditions for the model
however the errors are not normally distributed iid. In fact, the skew
shows dangerous over-estimations which need to be addressed. Although
this could also be due to the small sample size where few outliers can
cause significant skew in the data distribution. \textbf{volatility

    \subsubsection{Remarks}\label{remarks}

The addition of moving averages into the models provides a high
dependency on sample size. However, the current model still provides an
acceptable estimation for the in sample forecasts.

It can be suggested for the model to be improved by fitting a GARCH(p,q)
model to also forecast future volatilities which can be observed in the
data over the second half of 2018.

    \section{Issues and questions}\label{issues-and-questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  ADF gives type 1 error when SP500 is log differenced once. Why?
\item
  Is it alright to normalise the variance by the maximum variance in
  that period?
\item
  how much should we focus on the maths behind the analysis? because
  there is a lot of analysis and therefore maths involved and due to the
  report limit, not all of it can be covered. From what I recall, you
  mentioned the audience having highschool level knowledge but the maths
  involved requires more than that. There are a lot of references made
  to for example YW or BC or BJ and i cant explain all of the tests done
  and why i chose that over other tests.
\item
  What should we talk about when we carryout the KMC? what aspect of it
  are we analysing?
\item
  Need to extract original data from
\item
  HIGHLY suggested that GARCH be fitted to VAR as residuals show
  heteroskedasticity
