       "     'details': \"The Government fully recognises the contribution that unpaid and family carers make in providing significant care and continuity of support to family and friends That is why in June 2018, the Department of Health and Social Care published a Carers Action Plan ‘Supporting carers today’, which set out a two-year programme of targeted work to support unpaid carers. It focuses on practical actions that are being undertaken to support carers, working across and beyond government.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is important to understand that paying a wage to an unpaid carer would change their status and it has never been the role of the Government to pay people for the tasks they undertake in the way that an employer would. This has been the approach of successive Governments and reflects wider social policy aims as well as issues of affordability.\\r\\n\\r\\nDepending on their individual circumstances, unpaid carers can access the full range of social security benefits. For example, we expect to spend around £3bn this year on Carer’s Allowance, and by 2024-25, forecast real spend is over £3.6bn.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the support unpaid carers need extends far beyond financial help and can’t just come from Government. We also need businesses, local communities, the voluntary sector and individuals to play their part. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur Carers Action Plan has delivered several actions aimed to help and support unpaid carers remain in work for as long as they wish by promoting the value of attracting and retaining carers by offering flexible working and additional support in the workplace. In doing so remaining in employment carers will stay financially stable and they will no longer need to cut back on essentials like food and heating; as well as gaining the intrinsic sense of value associated with work and contributing to the wider economy. Some of the key projects that offer support to unpaid carers have included the following:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Carer Confident benchmarking scheme (https://www.employersforcarers.org/carer-confident/what-are-the-benefits) seeking to encourage workplaces to have policies in place and a culture which enables unpaid carers to stay in employment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Timewise flexible jobs (https://www.timewisejobs.co.uk/advice-ideas/articles/advice-for-carers/) hub to support unpaid carers to stay in employment and to break down barriers for carers getting the flexible jobs they reported they need that could fit around their caring responsibilities. The Hub offers a job search by flexibility as well as advice on finding a suitable job and case studies of those who have done this. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe also committed £5m to support 'returners', who are people who have taken time out of employment for caring responsibilities and want to return to paid work. In 2018, the Government Equalities Office launched a private sector grant fund, which has now awarded in the region of £1.5m to 16 organisations supporting returners. The funding was awarded to projects that created new job opportunities, address specific barriers to returners and increased the understanding of how best to support people to gain paid employment.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we recognise there is still more to do. That is why we are also consulting on a proposal for unpaid carers of one week leave per year alongside existing employment rights. A consultation (https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/carers-leave) was launched on the 16th March and will run until the 3rd August.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore broadly, we know there is a need for a long-term action plan for social care. Putting social care on a sustainable footing, where everyone is treated with dignity and respect, is one of the biggest challenges that we face as a society. There are complex questions to address, which is why we have invited cross-party talks. These will take place at the earliest opportunity considering the current coronavirus circumstances. The government will then bring forward a plan for social care for the longer term.\\r\\n\\r\\nDepartment of Health and Social Care\\r\\n\",\n",

This visa extension will be free of charge and those benefitting will not pay the Immigration Health Surcharge; the Prime Minister recently extended this to all those working to support our NHS.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Home Office is also extending an immediate offer of indefinite leave to remain, free of charge, to the families and dependants of NHS support staff and social care workers who die as result of contracting coronavirus. This offer of indefinite leave to remain will be effective immediately and retrospectively. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have put in place measures to allow those who want to start working for, or studying at, a registered sponsor to commence work or study prior to their visa being granted.  We have removed the limit on volunteer work for visiting academic researchers, holders of short-term visas who are permitted to volunteer, students and Tier 2 workers where an NHS job is a second job.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also temporary concessions in place for people unable to meet the requirements of the family Immigration Rules to enter or remain in the UK due to coronavirus.  If customers are unable to travel back to the UK due to coronavirus travel restrictions and their leave has expired, a short break in continuous residence will be overlooked.  We have made changes to the Minimum Income Requirement for those who have experienced a loss of income due to coronavirus and, in some cases, we will be able to decide applications without seeing certain specified documents if customers cannot get them due to coronavirus. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo become a British citizen a person must meet several statutory criteria.  These are set out in the British Nationality Act 1981.  They must have lived here for a minimum number of years and become a permanent resident.  These criteria are designed to ensure an applicant has a strong connection to the UK and intends to remain here.  Applicants must also satisfy a good character requirement and show they have sufficient knowledge of the English language and of life in the UK.  Citizenship cannot be granted on a discretionary basis.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is fair all those who want to become British citizens should meet the same core requirements and citizenship is granted on a consistent basis. In addition, several countries do not allow their citizens to hold dual nationality and can penalise people for doing so. This underlines the benefit of an applicant-led approach to citizenship, rather than the automatic grant suggested in the petition.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe therefore do not believe it would be right to grant citizenship to all foreign nationals in the UK, irrespective of their length of residence or level of connection with the UK, other than being present here currently, and will not be doing so. Those who have made the UK their home, have lived and become settled here, have taken time to learn about life in the UK, are able to speak English, and are of good character, are able to apply under the current law.\\r\\n\\r\\nHome Office',\n",

       "     'details': 'Public Health England’s (PHE) Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards (CRCE) takes the lead on public health matters associated with radiofrequency electromagnetic fields, or radio waves, used in telecommunications.\\r\\n\\r\\nCentral to PHE advice is that exposure to radio waves should comply with the guidelines published by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). In compliance with PHE advice, mobile network operators have committed to follow the ICNIRP guidelines.\\u202f Therefore we have no plans to hold an investigation. \\r\\n\\r\\nICNIRP is an independent organisation which is formally recognised by the World Health Organization. It issues guidelines on human exposure to EMF, based upon the consensus view of a large amount of research carried out over many years. This includes the frequencies used by 5G and all other mobile / wireless technologies. \\r\\n\\r\\nICNIRP guidelines apply up to 300 GHz, well beyond the maximum (a few tens of GHz) frequencies under discussion for 5G.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome 5G technology will use similar frequencies to existing communications systems. Other 5G technology will work at higher frequencies, where the main change would be less penetration of radio waves through materials. \\r\\n\\r\\nPHE updated its guidance, published in October 2019, in respect of 5G and summarised its guidance as follows:    \\r\\n\\r\\n“It is possible that there may be a small increase in overall exposure to radio waves when 5G is added to an existing network or in a new area. However, the overall exposure is expected to remain low relative to the guidelines and, as such, there should be no consequences for public health.” \\r\\n\\r\\nOfcom undertakes measurements to confirm that transmitter base stations do not exceed\\r\\nthe limits set out in the ICNIRP guidelines. Over the last few months, Ofcom has measured\\r\\n5G sites in 10 UK towns and cities and in all cases, the levels recorded are a small fraction\\r\\nof those in the ICNIRP guidelines.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe maximum measured at any mobile site was approximately 1.5% of those levels –\\r\\nincluding signals from other mobile technologies such as 3G and 4G. The highest level from\\r\\n5G signals specifically was 0.039% of the maximum set out in the guidelines.\\r\\n\\r\\nA summary of PHE advice on 5G can be accessed in the following links: \\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/5g-technologies-radio-waves-and-health/5g-technologies-radio-waves-and-health\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mobile-phone-base-stations-radio-waves-and-health/mobile-phone-base-stations-radio-waves-and-health \\r\\n\\r\\nICNIRP’s guidance on 5G can be found here:\\r\\nhttps://www.icnirp.org/en/applications/5g/5g.html\\r\\n\\r\\nDepartment for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport',\n",

       "     'details': 'We want to get all children and young people back into education as soon as the scientific advice allows because it is the best place for them to learn, and because we know how important it is for their mental wellbeing to have social interactions with their peers, carers and teachers.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the 1 June we have been able to take the first, cautious, steps towards that. As the Prime Minister confirmed on 28 May, the government’s five tests are being met and we can begin to ease the lockdown restrictions across England.\\r\\n\\r\\nInformed by all the evidence, including the latest scientific and medical advice, this means that nurseries and other early years providers, including childminders, are now able to welcome back children of all ages. Primary schools are able to welcome back pupils in Reception, year 1 and year 6, in smaller class sizes. This is alongside the children of critical workers and vulnerable children of all ages who will continue to be able to attend.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe know that not every school or early years provider will have been able to open for more children from 1 June. We recognise that they need time to plan and to implement the protective measures we have asked them to put in place. We are continuing to work with the sector to ensure any schools experiencing difficulties are supported to open more widely as soon as possible.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 15 June, secondary schools and FE colleges will be providing face-to-face support for years 10 and 12 and 16-19 students in the first year of a two-year study programme, who are due to take key exams next year. This support will supplement their remote education, which will continue to be the main method of education during this term for these students, as only a quarter of this cohort will be able to attend at any one time to limit the risk of transmission. Children of critical workers and vulnerable children in all year groups will continue to be able to attend full-time.\\r\\n\\r\\nA decision to welcome back these key year groups has not been taken lightly and has been based on the best and latest scientific advice. In doing so we recognise that it is vital that we continue to control the numbers attending schools and colleges to reduce the risk of increasing transmission, and that schools can put measures in place to further reduce the risks and create an inherently safer environment. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Department for Education has published detailed guidance for schools and other education settings on how to prepare for opening to more pupils. This includes planning guides for early years providers and for primary schools, and further guidance for secondary schools and further education colleges.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrucially, we have provided guidance on the protective measures that schools, nurseries and colleges should implement to reduce the risks of transmission. This includes restricting class sizes, limiting contact and mixing between groups, and encouraging regular hand washing and frequent cleaning. This advice was developed in close consultation with Public Health England.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe safety of children, young people and staff remains our top priority. All staff and children, including the under 5s, will have access to testing if they develop symptoms of coronavirus. This will enable the right response where a case is confirmed, including using a ‘test and trace’ approach to rapidly identify people most at risk of having been exposed to the virus. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe continue to follow the best scientific advice and believe that this cautious, phased return is the most sensible course of action to take. We will only open for additional year groups if the most up-to-date assessment of the risk posed by the virus indicates it is appropriate to have larger numbers of children within schools. And of course, as the Prime Minister set out, we will not hesitate to reverse the policy if necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nDepartment for Education\\r\\n',\n",

       "     'details': 'Council Regulation (EC) No. 1099/2009 on the protection of animals at the time of killing makes it an offence to cause any animals avoidable pain, distress or suffering during their killing and related operations. In particular, animals must be stunned properly so that they are unconscious and unable to feel pain during the slaughter process. In this legislation, the only exception to the rule that animals must be stunned before slaughter is where animals are slaughtered in accordance with religious rites.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Welfare of Animals at the Time of Killing (England) Regulations 2015 (WATOK) implement and enforce Regulation 1099/2009 and contain stricter national rules which provide greater protection for animals at the time of killing, including for religious slaughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere an animal has been subject to religious slaughter without stunning, it is not lawful to shackle, hoist or move it in any way until it is unconscious.  Systematic checks must be carried out to ensure that animals do not present any signs of consciousness or sensibility before they are released from restraint and do not present any signs of life before undergoing any further processing.  Slaughterhouse operators must have Standard Operating Procedures in place that specify the actions to be taken if an animal still presents signs of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nNational regulations on religious slaughter have a long history. Religious slaughter was first debated in Parliament in 1875. The Slaughter of Animals Act 1933 introduced a legal requirement for stunning of animals prior to slaughter, and contained an exemption where animals were slaughtered for specific religious communities. Over the years, the rules governing religious slaughter have developed to provide additional protection for animals slaughtered in accordance with religious rites and have maintained the long-standing exception for Jews and Muslims to eat meat prepared in accordance with their religious beliefs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnimal welfare is monitored and enforced in all approved slaughterhouses by Official Veterinarians of the Food Standards Agency. They will monitor that all animal welfare requirements are met to ensure that animals are spared avoidable pain, distress or suffering.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Government is currently engaging with religious communities and other stakeholders on issues relating to religious slaughter, including meat traceability and minimising non-stun slaughter volumes. \\r\\n\\r\\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs',\n",

The period of leave granted is dependent on the length and type of course studied. Courses at degree level or above, in excess of one year are granted a four-month period at the end of the course. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Graduate route will enable eligible students to apply for work or look for work for two years after completing their studies. The Graduate route represents a significant improvement in our offer to international students, but as it takes time to introduce a new route we will not be offering it to those who graduate this summer (2020).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Graduate route will be launched in the summer of 2021. To be eligible for the route, students must successfully complete a degree at undergraduate level or above at a Higher Education Provider (HEP) with a track record of compliance and must hold valid leave as a student when the route is introduced. The status of each provider is listed within the register of sponsors below, HEPs have the status of ‘Tier 4 sponsor – track record’ on the register: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-licensed-sponsors-students.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll international students who graduate after this point, including current students, will be eligible. Those students who complete their courses prior to the introduction of the route can still benefit from the favourable switching provision into the skilled work route. Presently students switching into the skilled work route from Tier 4 are subject to a reduced salary threshold and their employers are not required to conduct a Resident Labour Market Test or pay the Immigration Skills Charge.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe recognise COVID-19 has had a detrimental effect on international students and we have worked with the education sector to mitigate the issues faced by international students during this difficult period. A series of exceptional concessions have been introduced to support international students during the COVID-19 pandemic. These measures include allowing students to study remotely via distance learning and permitting students to apply for further courses from within the UK where this otherwise wouldn’t be permitted. \\r\\n\\r\\nFull details of the exceptional measures which have been put in place can be located within the Tier 4 COVID-19 guidance below:\\r\\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-tier-4-sponsors-migrants-and-short-term-students. \\r\\n\\r\\nStudents switching into Tier 2 are able to commence their employment prior to a decision being made on their applications, provided they have a valid Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS), have applied prior to the expiry of their current period of leave and the role they will be employed in matches the role listed on the CoS. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have also temporarily amended the Right to Work check procedure to make the process simpler and enable checks to be conducted electronically.

       "     'details': 'The Government is mindful of the severe impact felt by the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors from recent events, and it is right to offer them exceptional assistance to meet the crisis. On the 17 March the Chancellor announced a business rates holiday for businesses in the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors, irrespective of rateable value, so that all eligible businesses will pay no business rates for 12 months.  This unprecedented action is expected to provide almost £10 billion in business rates relief in 2020-21. This year over half of all properties in England will pay no business rates.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has published guidance for Local Authorities on the implementation of the business rates holiday for the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors. This includes definitions of properties that will benefit from the relief, though it is for individual Local Authorities to make decisions on eligibility for the relief in their own area based on this guidance. This guidance is available online here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/business-rates-retail-discount-guidance\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Government is keenly aware that COVID-19, and the extraordinary measures that have been taken to prevent its spread, present an unprecedented challenge for businesses in many sectors, and has sympathy with all those affected. However, there are no plans for the immediate change to the guidance or the scope of reliefs. If any businesses have difficulties paying their business rates bills, they should be encouraged to contact their local authority to discuss whether other support may be available. \\r\\n\\r\\nAny healthcare practice may already benefit from Small Business Rate Relief (SBRR) where they are occupying a single property with a rateable value below £15,000. Businesses in receipt of SBRR may also be eligible for the £10,000 Small Business grant.  You can find more information on grants here: https://www.gov.uk/business-coronavirus-support-finder\\r\\n\\r\\nNHS England has issued guidance for dentists holding or working on NHS contracts, which is clear that dentists will be fully remunerated for the NHS work they would have otherwise undertaken during the pandemic, subject to some basic requirements. This guidance applies to dentists working on wholly NHS contracts and those working on a mix of NHS and private contracts. NHS England has published a series of guidance which sets out that dental practices can also access wider Treasury support for their private dental earnings. The latest guidance, issued on 15 April, can be found here: https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/dental-practice/\\r\\n \\r\\nA range of further measures to support all businesses, including those not eligible for the business rates holiday, have also been made available.

There are approximately 2000 residential park home sites in England.\\r\\n\\r\\nResidents of park home sites will have a Mobile Homes Act 1983 written agreement which gives the resident security of tenure. The agreement will amongst others set out; the obligations of the site owner and resident; the process for selling a home, reviewing pitch fees and making site rules; and the limited circumstances in which the site owner can terminate the agreement.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere the planning permission granted for the whole or part of a caravan site is for holiday use only, there will be restrictions on when the site can be opened and in particular, the use of the site for permanent residential purposes. The Government is therefore unable to give holiday caravan and lodge owners residential rights on caravan sites where the existing planning permission requires those sites to be used for holiday purposes only.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Government is aware that holiday caravans and lodges are sometimes mis-sold to consumers as permanent residential homes. Purchasers in such cases are not provided the correct information about the caravan/lodge or the site’s planning permission. In other instances, consumers are not provided with written agreements which clearly set out the terms and conditions for occupying a pitch on the holiday site, selling a caravan or terminating an agreement. In other examples, aggressive sales methods are used to coerce consumers into making a purchase.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Government is aware of the impacts such actions can have on consumers and that is why it brought together comprehensive provisions for consumers in the Consumer Rights Act 2015 to supplement other consumer protection regulations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe protections in place include:\\r\\n\\r\\n•\\tprohibiting traders from engaging in unfair commercial practices against consumers (e.g. in the course of marketing and selling). \\r\\n\\r\\n•\\tTraders must provide consumers with the information they need to make informed purchasing decisions. Prohibition of commercial practices which through false information or misleading presentation cause, or are likely to cause, the average consumer to make a different choice. \\r\\n\\r\\n•\\tProhibition of commercial practices which through the use of harassment, coercion (including the use of physical force) or undue influence are likely to significantly impair the average consumer’s freedom of choice in relation to goods or services.  \\r\\n\\r\\n•\\tA requirement that goods sold by traders must be as described and of a satisfactory quality and be fit for a particular purpose if that purpose was made known to the trader by the consumer. \\r\\n\\r\\n•\\tIf a product does not meet these requirements a consumer has a right to reject the goods within 30 days from the purchase and receive a full refund; require the trader after 30 days of purchase to repair or replace faulty goods within a reasonable time; where the consumer is entitled to a refund and returns the goods within the first six months from purchase, the trader cannot make a deduction from the amount of any refund to take into account of the use that the consumer has had from the goods (except in relation to motor vehicles). \\r\\n\\r\\n•\\tTerms applying to consumer contracts, need to comply with unfair terms rules. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has published guidance on unfair contract terms at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unfair-contract-terms-cma37. \\r\\n\\r\\n•\\tA private right of redress to consumers who have been the victim of a misleading or aggressive commercial practice. \\r\\n\\r\\n•\\tRequiring online and remote sellers to provide clear information on the cost, delivery terms etc, and cancellation rights including a cancellation form, when any agreement is made.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnforcement of consumer legislation is by local authority trading standards services and the CMA.

       "     'summary': 'The Government is doing whatever is necessary to deal with Covid-19 now, while continuing to invest in the country’s future infrastructure. That is why we are getting on with HS2.',\n",
       "     'details': 'Our absolute priority right now is on tackling the spread of COVID-19 to protect our NHS and save lives. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is why the Government has made clear that it will do whatever is required to ensure that the NHS has the resources it needs, while taking unprecedented steps to support the economy and UK businesses at this difficult time. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut this does not mean we should delay work on our long-term plans to level up the country and invest in the country’s future infrastructure. The decision earlier this year to proceed with HS2 will provide thousands of construction workers and businesses across the country with certainty at a time when they need it most. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe project will contribute towards sustainable growth in towns, cities and regions across the country, spreading prosperity and opportunity more evenly. It will act as a catalyst for job creation, the development of new homes and ultimately, the regeneration of major cities and towns along the HS2 route. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to this, HS2 will play a key role in achieving the UK’s transition to carbon net zero by 2050. This is because, once HS2 is in operation, it will offer some of the lowest carbon emissions per passenger km – seven times less than passenger cars and 17 times less than domestic air travel in 2030. \\r\\n\\r\\nHS2 will also free up space on the West Coast, East Coast and Midland Mainlines for more passenger and freight services. Rail freight produces 76% less CO2 per tonne of cargo compared to road haulage. Every extra freight train takes up to 76 lorries off the road. In short, by providing a cleaner, greener way to travel, HS2 will help cut the number of cars and lorries on our roads, cut demand for domestic flights, and help the country’s fight against climate change.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the Prime Minister has said that HS2 should only continue if costs are kept under tight control. So, when we made the decision to proceed with HS2 in February, this came alongside a package of reform measures to instil financial order, discipline and transparency, including a Ministerial Taskforce and dedicated HS2 Minister to oversee the project and provide accountability.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Department has also now published the Phase One (West Midlands to London) Full Business Case (FBC) for HS2. And, in April, HS2 Ltd issued ‘notice to proceed’ so its contractors can begin main construction works along the Phase One route. This provides certainty to thousands of construction workers and businesses across the country at this difficult time. This decision protects jobs and means that work can truly begin on delivering this transformational project. \\r\\n \\r\\nThis is why we are getting on with HS2, which already employs 9,000 people and is crucial to levelling up our regions, providing vital rail capacity and meeting our 2050 obligations on carbon reduction.\\r\\n\\r\\nDepartment for Transport',\n",

       "     'summary': 'The business grants schemes are helping many thousands of small businesses and are just one part of the Government’s unprecedented package of support for business during the Covid-19 crisis.',\n",
       "     'details': 'The Government recognises that this is a very challenging time for businesses in a wide variety of sectors. Small businesses facing high fixed property-related costs are in particular need of support because they are less likely than larger businesses to have sufficient cash reserves to see them through the Covid-19 crisis. The Small Business Grants Fund and the Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Grants Fund are designed to help the smallest businesses, as well as small businesses in sectors which have been especially hard hit by the decline in customer footfall which has taken place since social distancing measures were introduced. The grants schemes are already helping thousands of small businesses in these situations: as of 11th May, over £9.1 billion worth of grants have been paid to over 742,000 business premises.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Government is aware that some small businesses have found themselves excluded from the existing business grants schemes because of the way they interact with the business rates system. That is why the Government has allocated up to an additional £617 million to Local Authorities to enable them to give discretionary grants to businesses in this situation. The Government has published detailed guidance on how Local Authorities should administer the Discretionary Grants Fund. The Government’s intention is for Local Authorities to prioritise the following types of business when making discretionary grants: small businesses in shared offices or other flexible work spaces such as industrial parks, science parks, incubators etc, which do not have their own business rates assessment; regular market traders who do not have their own business rates assessment; B&Bs which pay Council Tax instead of business rates; and charity properties in receipt of charitable business rates relief which would otherwise have been eligible for Small Business Rates Relief or Rural Rate Relief.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal Authorities may choose to focus payments on those priority groups which are most relevant to their local areas. Local Authorities may also choose to pay grants to businesses outside of these priority groups, according to local economic need, so long as the business was trading on 11th March, and has not received any other cash grant funded by central Government. \\r\\n\\r\\nBusinesses will need to apply to their Local Authority in order to receive grants. Each Local Authority will need to create their own process, and should look to do so as quickly as possible. We encourage businesses to look out for their Local Authority’s version of this scheme, and to contact their Local Authority for more information in due course.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe priority of all business grants schemes continues to be to help the smallest businesses, and small businesses which are facing significant property-related costs and operate in sectors which have been particularly hard hit by the steep decline in customer footfall. \\r\\n\\r\\nBusinesses which can’t receive business grants should be able to benefit from other measures in the Government’s generous package of support for business, including: a twelve-month business rate holiday for all retail, hospitality and leisure properties, regardless of their size; an option to defer VAT payments by up to twelve months; the Bounce Back Loan Scheme, which will ensure that small and micro businesses can quickly access loans of up to £50,000 which are 100% guaranteed by the Government; the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, now extended to cover all businesses including those which would be able to access commercial credit; the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, to support businesses with their wage bill; and the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme, to provide support to the self-employed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHM Treasury',\n",

       "     'details': 'The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) helps those adversely affected by COVID-19. It means the UK has one of the most generous self-employed COVID-19 support schemes in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Chancellor highlighted when announcing the SEISS, to ensure that the scheme is deliverable, only those who are already in self-employment and had a tax return for 2018-19 are able to apply. Unfortunately, it has not been possible to include those who began trading after the 2018-19 tax year in the SEISS. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a very difficult decision and it was taken for practical reasons. Unlike for employees, the income of self-employed people is not reported monthly, but at the end of each tax year on the individual’s Income Tax Self Assessment return. This means that the most reliable and up-to-date record of self-employed income is from the 2018-19 tax returns. The Government recognises that those who started trading more recently will not have submitted a tax return for the 2018-19 tax year, and it considered alternative approaches. Unfortunately, HMRC would not be able to distinguish genuine self-employed individuals who started trading in 2019-20 from fake applications by fraudulent operators and organised criminal gangs seeking to exploit the SEISS.\\r\\n\\r\\nHMRC designed the SEISS using information already in hand, in order to make it deliverable quickly and to minimise the risk of fraud. Expanding the scope would have required HMRC to collect and verify new information. This would have taken longer to deliver and put at risk the other schemes which the Government committed to delivering as quickly as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nIneligibility for the SEISS does not mean there is no other support available. The SEISS is part of a comprehensive package of support for self-employed people, including Bounce Back loans, income tax deferrals, rental support, increased levels of Universal Credit, mortgage holidays and the various business support introduced to protect businesses during this time.

       "     'summary': 'HE providers must deliver high quality courses.\\r\\nIf students are unhappy they should first complain to their provider and if their concerns are unresolved they can ask OIA to consider their complaint.',\n",
       "     'details': 'Government recognises the challenges facing students and supports them in their desire to continue receiving the best possible learning experience from our higher education (HE) providers. We consider it in the best interests of all students that they receive a high quality online education during this unprecedented period that allows them to progress and to complete their studies within the time period they had been anticipating.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some fantastic and innovative examples of high-quality online learning being delivered by HE providers across the country, and the sector is working hard to provide and prepare learning materials for the summer and autumn terms. Universities are autonomous and responsible for setting their own fees. In deciding to keep charging full fees, universities will of course want to ensure that they can continue to deliver courses which are fit for purpose and help students progress their qualifications. Any refund is a matter for universities, so we are not considering a write off of tuition fee loans.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe believe that students should be at the heart of the HE system. The Office for Students (OfS), the regulator in England, has committed to protecting students throughout the present crisis and has published guidance for registered providers on how it will approach the regulation of quality and standards, and this includes practical ways in which students can complete their studies whilst ensuring quality and standards are upheld. Providers are already making these arrangements and the Government is in continuous contact with the sector to support the continuation of teaching and assessment. The Government is also working closely with the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education to ensure students continue to leave HE with qualifications that have real value, reflect their hard work and allow people to progress. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Government’s clear expectation is that HE providers should make all reasonable efforts to enable students to complete their studies. If providers are unable to facilitate adequate online tuition, they should seek to avoid charging students for any additional terms they may need to undergo as a consequence – avoiding effectively charging them twice. Whether or not an individual student is entitled to a refund of fees will depend on the specific contractual arrangements between the provider and student. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is important that students continue to receive a good standard of education, and they are entitled to make a complaint if they feel that their HE provider has not taken sufficient steps to appropriately respond to this situation. In the first instance, students should speak to their provider to see if they can resolve their complaint. We expect student complaints and appeals processes to be operated flexibly, accessibly, and sympathetically by providers to resolve any concerns. If a student at a provider in England or Wales is not satisfied with their provider’s response, they can ask the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education (OIA) to consider their complaint. \\r\\n\\r\\nGovernment also understands that it may be difficult for some students to finish their current year of study for personal reasons, and that this will undoubtedly be a source of concern to many. Where students are unable to complete their current year of study or need to repeat a year due to compelling personal reasons, they may be eligible for an additional year of fee loan support above their standard entitlement under existing arrangements. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, Government has worked with the OfS to enable providers to draw upon existing funding to increase hardship funds and support disadvantaged students impacted by COVID-19. As a result, providers will be able to use the funding, totalling £46m across April and May, towards student hardship funds and mental health support, as well as to support providers’ access and participation plans.\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernment has previously responded to a petition concerning tuition fee refunds for both COVID-19 disruption and strike action.

Universities also have diverse operating models and their financial situations will be different.\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernment plays no direct role in the provision of student residential accommodation, whether it is managed by universities or private companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nRent refunds are a matter for the higher education providers and private companies that students contract with for their accommodation. Government is not considering using taxpayers’ money to reimburse any parties in relation to rent paid for periods when rooms are unused.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Government encourages universities and private hall providers to be fair in their decisions about rent charges for this period. A number of universities and large companies have waived rents for the summer term or released students early from their contracts.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate student accommodation providers who refund rents may be able to access the support packages announced by the Chancellor to protect businesses (see: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/financial-support-for-businesses-during-coronavirus-covid-19)\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents who are tenants with individual private landlords can discuss the possibility of an early release from their tenancy agreement. Students impacted by Covid-19 who rent from private landlords can now be assured that eviction proceedings cannot begin against them for 3 months. As a result, no renter in private accommodation will be forced out of their home during this difficult time. For further information and the specific legislation please see http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/7/schedule/29 (Students renting under licence, as applies in most halls, are ineligible for this particular support.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe negotiation of rent waivers and early releases from contracts is a matter between the parties concerned.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents will continue to receive scheduled payments of loans towards their living costs for the remainder of the current, 2019/20, academic year.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents with a part-time employment contract should speak to their employer about the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which has been set up to help pay staff wages and keep people in employment (see: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/financial-support-for-businesses-during-coronavirus-covid-19)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have also asked that HE providers pay particular attention to the additional financial hardships that are being faced by student staff who have been reliant on income from campus-based jobs at this time.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany providers will have hardship funds to support students in times of need, including emergencies.  The expectation is that where any student requires additional support, providers will support them through their own hardship funds.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have worked closely with the Office for Students to enable providers to draw upon existing funding to increase hardship funds and support disadvantaged students impacted by COVID-19.  As a result, providers will be able to use the funding, worth around £23 million per month for April and May, towards student hardship funds.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is also important to stress that accommodation providers should not have previously instructed any students to leave – if an accommodation provider did formally instruct a student to leave the property, then it would not be acceptable to continue to charge student rents.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents who think their accommodation provider is treating them unfairly can raise a complaint under the accommodation codes of practice as long as their provider is a code member. The codes can be found at: https://www.thesac.org.uk/ , https://www.unipol.org.uk/the-code/how-to-complain and https://www.rla.org.uk/about/nrla-code-of-practice.shtml\\r\\n\\r\\nAs regards tuition fees, universities are autonomous and responsible for setting their own fees.

       "     'details': 'The Government recognises the importance of physical activity to the nation’s health and wellbeing and is working with the gym and leisure sector to reopen facilities as soon as possible in a safe and controlled way. Government’s first priority is to ensure that Covid-19 is brought under control and that actions it takes do not undermine efforts to protect public health.\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernment is in discussions with a range of sports organisations, including the gym and leisure sector, about the actions that would need to be taken to restart grassroots sport and reopen facilities in a safe way. It has asked sport and physical activity organisations to consider what steps they would need to take, and guidance they would need to develop, to allow this to happen. This will be used to support the government’s decision-making around future public health guidelines.\\r\\n \\r\\nThis is not straightforward. There are many issues to consider, including how gyms could reopen and operate whilst meeting social distancing guidelines, how access in and out of facilities may need to be changed, whether facilities will have enough workers to operate safely and effectively, and whether people will be willing to come back to gyms if they do reopen. The Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy is also considering what guidance is needed on how workplaces can operate effectively and safely once the lockdown starts to ease.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Government has also published updated guidance on grassroots sport which sets out information on the phased return of outdoor sport and recreation. This includes further details for members of the public on how they can take unlimited exercise outside, and on the steps that outdoor facilities need to take to re-open, should they wish to do so, from Wednesday 13 May. As part of this, people will be able to exercise outdoors one-on-one with a personal trainer, providing that social distancing is maintained.\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernment is clear that keeping people physically active is very important for a large number of reasons, including physical and mental health. However, as the government has made clear, the overwhelming priority of its plan for addressing the next phase of the virus is to keep the country safe. As such, a return to physical activity and grassroots sport, including reopening gyms and leisure centres will need to be done in a way that is: consistent with public health guidelines; minimises risk to participants and volunteer and staff; communicated clearly and consistently with guidance consistent across different sports and activities to reduce the risk of confusion; flexible so that arrangements can be altered and adapted if restrictions or public health advice is changed.\\r\\n\\r\\nDepartment for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport',\n",

       "     'details': \"The licence fee is payment for a licence to watch or receive television programmes.The government is clear that the licence fee remains a licence to watch or receive television programmes, and is not a fee for BBC services. It is payable regardless of whether the licence holder ever watches the BBC. Licence fee revenue is not just used to fund the BBC, it is also used for other strategic public service objectives including S4C (the Welsh- language broadcaster). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Royal Charter is the constitutional basis of the BBC which guarantees the BBC’s independence and provides the framework for how the BBC is governed and funded. It sets the BBC’s Mission which is ‘to act in the public interest, serving all audiences through the provision of impartial, high-quality and distinctive output and services which inform, educate and entertain’. It also sets the Public Purposes which include a duty to provide impartial news and information to help people understand and engage with the world around them and to show the most creative, highest quality and distinctive output and services. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the BBC's public purposes is ‘to reflect the United Kingdom, its culture and values to the world’ which the BBC does partly through the World Service - an international news service available on radio, television and online which provides impartial news reports and analysis in English and 40 other languages. The government strongly supports the BBC’s mission to bring high quality and impartial news to global audiences in some of the most remote places in the world, particularly where free speech is limited. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe licence fee funding model was considered as part of Charter Review which is the regular process for the government to review all aspects of the BBC. The BBC Charter Review consultation in 2015-16 received over 192,000 responses and found the majority of the public do not want to see a change in the way that the BBC is funded: 60% thought the current licence fee model did not need to be changed. As a result, the government committed to maintain the current model. It will be reconsidered again ahead of the next Charter Review, which is set to be completed by 2027. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the government believes that it is right to look again at whether the criminal sanction remains appropriate for TV licence fee evasion, given ongoing concerns that the criminal sanction is unfair and disproportionate. On 5 February the government launched a consultation on whether TV licence evasion should be decriminalised. This consultation closed on 1 April 2020 and received over 150,000 responses. The government is considering the submissions and we will respond in due course. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, the government has recently announced the introduction of a new payment plan for the TV licence, known as the Simple Payment Plan, from 1 April 2020. The Simple Payment Plan is a new, flexible payment instalment scheme that allows customers to pay in equal fortnightly or monthly instalments throughout the year, and is available to certain customers who currently struggle to pay the TV licence fee. The government will consider whether this payment plan may be extended further to increase flexibility and convenience for all licence fee payers. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe government is committed to ensuring that the BBC and all public service broadcasters adapt to a fast changing market, and keeping them at the heart of our world class TV sector. This work will begin well in advance of the next Charter and will include looking at the licence fee funding model. \\r\\n\\r\\nDepartment for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport\",\n",

To do this, in January 2019, the NHS published a fully costed Long Term Plan (LTP), setting out how it would transform services and ensure the NHS continues to deliver a world-class service fit for the 21st Century. Delivering the LTP is a top priority for this Government, and to support this, we will provide the NHS with an extra £33.9bn per year, by 2023/24 - the largest, longest financial settlement in the history of the NHS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Long Term Plan sets out the NHS’ ambitions to provide more timely, joined-up care out of hospital, reduce pressures on urgent and emergency care, and deliver the fastest expansion in mental health services in the NHS’s history. The Plan will ensure that every baby will have the best start to life by improving maternity care, and we will improve outcomes for all major diseases through better prevention, detection, treatment and recovery. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo support integration strategically, from April 2021 all areas of England will be covered by Integrated Care Systems, allowing local NHS organisations to work alongside local government and other partners more closely than ever before, to plan and improve care for their populations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NHS has also published a set of recommendations for legislative changes that would enable the NHS to go faster and further in realising the ambitions set out in the Long Term Plan.

To be eligible, a business must be based in the UK and be impacted by COVID-19, have an annual turnover of no more than £45 million, and be seeking a loan up to £5 million. The scheme is delivered through commercial lenders, backed by the government-owned British Business Bank. There are more than 40 accredited lenders able to offer the scheme, including all the major banks. \\r\\n\\r\\n•\\tCoronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme – all firms with a turnover of more than £45 million will now be able to apply for up to £25 million of finance, and larger firms with a turnover of more than £250 million can apply for up to £50 million. The Government will provide a guarantee to enable banks to make these loans. It will support business that were viable before the COVID-19 outbreak, which are otherwise unable to access the finance they need.\\r\\nAll of these measures have been designed to ensure that companies of any size receive the help they need to get through this difficult time – including airports, airlines and the wider supply chain.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf airlines or airports find themselves in trouble as a result of COVID-19 even following the Government’s cross-economy wage and financial interventions, the Transport Secretary and Chancellor have confirmed that the Government is prepared to enter discussions with individual companies seeking bespoke support as a last resort, having exhausted all other options. Any intervention would need to represent value for money for taxpayers.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther details of all these schemes and support can be found at https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/business-support\\r\\n\\r\\nDepartment for Transport',\n",

       "     'summary': 'The Government recognises the devastating effects of motor neurone disease.  It is a key priority to provide access to the most effective and innovative medicines and treatments for NHS patients.',\n",
       "     'details': 'We are very sorry to learn about anyone who has been diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND). We recognise the immense challenges faced by those who are suffering with this truly devastating and incurable disease. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Government understands how important it is for patients to have access to the most effective medicines and treatments. We are making the NHS one of the most pro-innovation healthcare systems in the world. The NHS Long-Term Plan and the Life Sciences Sector Deals set out a clear vision of a health system which prioritises innovation and delivers faster patient access to life-changing products.  The Accelerated Access Collaborative (AAC), brings together the leaders from Government, the NHS and industry to tackle the barriers to the development and adoption of innovation in the UK. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll medicinal products are required to have a marketing authorisation (a licence) before they can be put on the market and given to patients outside of a regulated clinical trial.  Licences are given based on a positive benefit/risk assessment by a regulatory authority considering the results of animal studies and data from clinical trials which are designed to show efficacy and safety in humans.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTo run a clinical trial, a company will make an application to a regulatory authority (in the UK this is the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency), and a research ethics committee, to ensure the clinical trials are conducted appropriately.  The company that manufactures NurOwn can choose where to conduct their clinical trials and in this case the company has not conducted one in the UK.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are various schemes by which UK patients may be able to access medicines before they are licensed. The early access to medicines scheme (EAMS) aims to give patients with life threatening or seriously debilitating conditions access to medicines that do not yet have a marketing authorisation.  Companies can choose whether to participate in the scheme, which runs in parallel with the normal licensing procedure. To date no EAMS application has been received by the manufacturer of NurOwn. UK patients may also be able to get access to unlicensed medicinal products which have been specially manufactured or imported to the order of a doctor for the treatment of individual patients.  UK legislation provides an exemption from the need for a marketing authorisation for a medicinal product which is supplied in response to an order from a doctor and is intended for use by a patient for whose treatment that person is directly responsible for.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is important that we have a system in place for making evidence-based decisions on whether new medicines should be routinely funded by the NHS. In England the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), makes evidence-based recommendations for the NHS on whether new licensed medicines represent a clinical and cost-effective use of resources. Where NICE recommends a medicine, NHS commissioners are legally required to make routine funding available so that clinicians can offer it to their patients.  As NurOwn is not yet licensed in this country NICE is not in a position to appraise this drug.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore widely we are investing over £1bn per year through the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), to fund research, and to provide the skills and facilities to enable high quality research in our health and care system. The NIHR provides the best possible environment for collaboration between the life sciences industry, charities, academia and the NHS. It supports, facilitates and enables life sciences industry collaborative and contract research, across the translational pathway from early translational (experimental medicine) research, through clinical research, to applied health research, including generation of high-quality evidence to support development and licencing of new medicines in the UK and elsewhere. \\r\\n \\r\\nWith regard to the drug inclisiran, (a new cholesterol lowering drug), in January 2020 we announced the innovative population health collaboration with Novartis. This is a world-leading example of the UK’s clinical trial innovation and technical expertise. It includes supporting a clinical trial of inclisiran, guiding the way to implementation of a new approach to care so that more people are protected against cardiovascular disease, and laying the foundations for more efficient manufacturing of new drugs. While the UK has always been open to collaborations with industry on innovative medicines that would benefit the UK population, any medicine would be subject MHRA and NICE approval processes. In line with this, inclisiran is completely subject to MHRA and NICE approval and assessment, and to the same standard of approval as any other medicine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDepartment of Health and Social Care',\n",

       "     'details': 'We are grateful for the amazing contribution that migrant workers within the NHS are playing at the current time, and recognise their commitment and dedication to keep vital services running and save lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have made provision for doctors, nurses and paramedics working for the NHS to automatically have their visas extended by one year if it is due to expire before 1 October 2020. The extension is free and they do not have to pay the normal immigration health surcharge. Family members will also have their visa extended. We are contacting NHS employers to identify staff eligible for this extension: the staff do not need to apply. We keep all of our policies under review and are continuing to consider how we can best support the NHS and its staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny migrant working in the NHS on a route which leads to settlement can apply to become a permanent resident in the UK after 5 years. Doctors and nurses, and those in other allied health professions which are on the UK Shortage Occupation List, are also exempt from having to meet the normal earnings thresholds for becoming a permanent resident in this way.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo become a British citizen you must meet a number of statutory criteria. These are set out in the British Nationality Act (1981). You must have lived here for a minimum number of years and become a permanent resident. These criteria are designed to ensure an applicant for citizenship has a strong connection to the UK and intends to remain here. Applicants must also satisfy a good character requirement and show they have sufficient knowledge of English language and of life in the UK.  Citizenship cannot be granted on a discretionary basis. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe believe it is fair that all those who want to become British citizens should meet the same core requirements, and for citizenship to be awarded on a consistent basis. It is also an approach which recognises the valuable contributions all migrants make to the UK, not only those working within the NHS.\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of countries do not allow their citizens to hold dual nationality, and can penalise people for doing so, hence granting British citizenship automatically could cause unintended issues for them.  This underlines the benefit of an applicant-led approach to citizenship.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough we are not currently looking at amending the citizenship requirements or introducing an automatic grant of it, we hope our NHS workers from across the globe will stay and make their lives in the UK they contribute so much to.\\r\\n\\r\\nHome Office\\r\\n',\n",

       "     'details': 'The Government is aware that COVID-19 presents unprecedented challenges to many UK businesses including the pubs sector. In order to support public services, individuals and businesses through the economic disruption caused by COVID-19 the Government announced an unprecedented £330 billion support package of temporary, timely and targeted measures. These included the introduction of a Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme offering loans of up to £5 million for SMEs through the British Business Bank, and a new lending facility from the Bank of England to help support liquidity among larger firms. The total of the available guarantees is equivalent to 15% of UK GDP. The package also gave all retail, hospitality and leisure businesses, including the pubs sector in England, a 100% business rates holiday for the next 12 months; and increasing grants to small businesses eligible for Small Business Rate Relief from £3,000 to £10,000. To assist the smallest SME’s the Government announced the new Bounce Back Loans Scheme, which will ensure that the smallest businesses can access up to £50,000 loans in a matter of just days. These loans will be from £2,000 up to £50,000, capped at 25% of firms’ turnover. The Government will provide lenders with a 100% guarantee on each loan, to give lenders the confidence they need to support the smallest businesses in the country. In addition, the Government will cover the first 12 months of interest payments and fees charged to the business by the lender and no repayments will be due during the first 12 months of the loan term, giving businesses the space they need to get through this difficult period.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the Small Business Grant Scheme, the Government will grant small businesses in the retail, hospitality or leisure sectors a higher grant of £25,000 per property, for each property that has a rateable value above £15,000 and below £51,000. Businesses in the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors which aren’t eligible for Small Business Rate Relief/Rural Rates Relief, will be eligible for a £10,000 grant per property, for each property that has a rateable value of £15,000 or below. \\r\\n\\r\\nFurther economic support for businesses, employees and individuals was announced on 20 March: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19/covid-19-support-for-businesses. The announcement included a new Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. It also included VAT deferral for all businesses, so UK VAT registered businesses will not need to pay any VAT due alongside their normal VAT return from 20 March through to the end of June – a deferral worth over £30 billion or 1.5% of GDP. Businesses will have until the end of the financial year (31 March 2021) to pay back any deferred VAT. This is to help support businesses with their cash flows and support individuals’ employment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Government notes the request for beer duty to be cut but has no plans to do so at this time.

       "     'details': 'NHS staff are our greatest asset. In these most difficult of times and with ever increasing pressures on the NHS, they work incredibly hard, always putting patients first and keeping them safe whilst providing the high-quality care we all expect.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe overriding principle during this time of national emergency is to ensure NHS staff do not feel forced to work if they are unwell by ensuring they receive full pay if they contract the virus or must self-isolate, and for staff not to have to use their annual leave for any COVID-19 related absence. It is right that those who work well beyond the call of duty should be paid for every hour they work and receive premium pay rates for working unsocial hours. It is vital we care for those that we all rely on to care for us. The NHS has introduced a free-to-use staff support line and text service which all NHS staff can use for support, signposting and confidential listening from trained respondents. NHS staff have also been given free access to a series of apps to support their mental health and wellbeing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the longer term we are committed to ensuring that the NHS employment offer continues to attract and retain the compassionate and dedicated staff the NHS needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe independent Pay Review Bodies make annual recommendations on pay rises for NHS staff. The Pay Review Bodies are made up of experts and their recommendations are based on comprehensive assessment of evidence from key stakeholders, including NHS system partners and trade unions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs part of our ambition to make the NHS the best employer in the world, the Department of Health and Social Care has reached multi-year pay and contract reform agreements with trade unions across the NHS workforce.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Agenda for Change staff (including nurses, midwives, healthcare assistants and others) the agreement, supported by the majority of trades unions and their members, delivers pay awards and contract reforms over three years from 2018/2019 to 2020/2021. The multi-year deal is already benefiting around one million NHS staff. Over the three years:\\r\\n\\r\\nstaff below the top of their pay band will receive pay increases of at least 9%; pay for most staff at the top of their pay band will rise by 6.5%;\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reforms agreed are not just about headline pay but changes that will help improve the working lives of our dedicated staff. For example, by supporting them to maintain their physical and mental health and wellbeing and introducing policies to help support staff to balance their working lives with family and personal commitments.\\r\\n\\r\\nJunior doctors are also benefiting from a multi-year agreement (2019/20 to 2022/23) which:\\r\\n\\r\\nensures all pay scales increase by at least 8.2% over the four years; includes a new higher pay point for around 1 in 8 junior doctors to reflect their level of responsibility; increases enhancements for those working the most onerous shifts; and further strengthens safety and rest limits.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur ambition is to reach similar multi-year pay and contract reform agreements with senior medical staff to reflect their roles as leaders in our NHS and attract and retain the specialists we need.\\r\\n\\r\\nTurning to General Practice, in 2019 NHS England agreed with trade unions a five-year GP contract framework which fixed funding for the core practice contract for five years. The new contract provided funding clarity and certainty to practices and the settlement covers all aspects of practice income and expenses including practice staff pay. The full package for GP contract reform also sought to address workload by providing additional staff though the Additional Roles Reimbursement Scheme and also saw the introduction of the new state-backed scheme for GP indemnity. As self-employed contractors to the NHS, it is largely up to GP practices how they distribute pay to their employees, although salaried GPs employed within the majority of practices are expected to be on terms and conditions no less favourable than those in the salaried GP model terms and conditions including the minimum and maximum salary. Employers have the flexibility to offer enhanced terms and conditions, for example, to aid recruitment and retention. We anticipate good employers would set wage rates that reflect the skills and experience of their staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe know pay is not the only reason healthcare workers choose a career in the NHS. The reward package also includes a pension scheme which is one of the best available. Members of the scheme can generally expect to receive around £3 to £6 in pension benefits value for every £1 they contribute.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NHS Long Term Plan outlines the next steps in our mission to make the NHS a world class employer and deliver the workforce the NHS needs. To deliver these commitments the interim People Plan details the vision and immediate actions to make the NHS the best place to work.  When published, the final NHS People Plan will set out the support and recognition that all NHS staff can expect to receive from their employer. \\r\\n\\r\\nDepartment of Health and Social Care',\n",

       "     'details': 'The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) is available to employers and individuals, including owner-managers operating under a limited company, who pay themselves a salary through a PAYE scheme. Employers can use a portal to claim for 80 per cent of the usual monthly wage costs of furloughed employees (employees on a leave of absence) up to £2,500 a month, plus the associated Employer National Insurance Contributions and minimum automatic enrolment employer pension contributions for that wage. This means owner-managers can furlough themselves and claim for 80 per cent of their usual monthly PAYE wage costs, up to £2,500 a month. More details about the CJRS are available at www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-for-wage-costs-through-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme.\\r\\n\\r\\nDividends are not covered by the CJRS. Income from dividends is a return on investment in the company, rather than wages; under current reporting mechanisms it is not possible for HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to distinguish between dividends derived from an individual’s own company and dividends from other sources, and between dividends in lieu of employment income and as returns from other corporate activity.  \\r\\n\\r\\nHMRC designed the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) using information they already had, in order to make it deliverable quickly and to minimise the risk of fraud. Expanding the scope would have required HMRC to collect and verify new information. This would have taken longer to deliver and put at risk the other schemes which the Government committed to delivering in a timely way.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, these schemes supplement the other significant support the Government has announced. Individuals can benefit from the Government’s relaxation of the earnings rules (known as the Minimum Income Floor) in Universal Credit. Further support for UK businesses includes the Bounce Back Loans Scheme for small businesses, the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme and the deferral of tax payments.

       "     'details': 'Covid-19 represents a significant challenge to the UK, we are working to mitigate the risks the current outbreak represents to our country and to individuals. The Home Office is working to ensure no international students are unfairly penalised, in relation to immigration matters, due to current events which are beyond their control. All the exceptional measures detailed below will be in place initially until 31 May, and will be kept under review. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll international students whose leave expires before 31 May or has already expired since the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak, can get their leave extended to 31 May, by contacting the Coronavirus Immigration Team at the following email address: CIH@homeoffice.gov.uk. Students need to provide their full name, date of birth, nationality, existing visa details and all emails must be in English. The situation will be reviewed before 31 May. Students who have been unable to travel due to Covid-19, will not be considered to be overstayers due to circumstances outside their control. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have also announced other exceptional arrangements to assist students and the education sector during this difficult period. Students who would otherwise be required to leave the country to apply for a further course of study, can now exceptionally apply to switch onto a further course of study from within the UK if their leave is due to expire before 31 May. This includes short-term students and migrants currently on visit visas. Students can exceptionally extend in country, provided they meet the visa requirements under Tier 4 and can commence a new course of study from the date of application. \\r\\n\\r\\nStudents, regardless of the level of study undertaken, are currently able to study via distance learning, rather than attending in person. Under usual circumstances, distance learning wouldn’t be permitted within the Tier 4 rules, however under current circumstances, studying remotely is permitted. Students studying courses below degree level are not required to undertake the 15 hours per week of classroom-based study which is normally required for a course to be considered full-time, if the sponsor is unable to provide this level of tuition. \\r\\n\\r\\nSponsors do not need to report students who are currently unable to study due to Coronavirus for non-attendance and students can defer their studies for a period exceeding 60 days without sponsors withdrawing them from the course. Students who are unable to complete their course within the length of their visa will be able to apply for visa extensions and will be exempt from the academic progression requirements usually associated with applications for a visa extension. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe 20 hours work per week restriction has been temporarily relaxed for students working within the NHS, to enable those students who wish to assist to do so. Students who are employed or volunteering with an NHS trust can work without restriction on the number of hours worked per week.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny student whose sponsor has suspended all study will also be able to work full-time. These students will be considered to be in ‘vacation time’ and as such the restrictions on the hours they can work is lifted. Students who are continuing to study via distance learning, will continue to be limited to 20 hours work per week during term-time.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are closely monitoring the situation and may announce further exceptions if needed depending on how the situation evolves. All measures which have been introduced will be kept under review and further measures will be introduced if necessary. The Government believes this approach strikes the right balance to deal with the situation, rather than extending visas indefinitely to deal with a temporary set of circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nFull details of the current exceptions that have been put in place can be found at the GOV.UK page below, this page is updated regularly to ensure that the information is up to date and reflects all of the temporary exemptions that have been made:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-uk-visa-applicants-and-temporary-uk-residents. \\r\\n\\r\\nHome Office',\n",

Key workers have already demonstrated remarkable commitment to keeping the public safe in the continuing fight against the virus. The Government hugely values and appreciates these vital contributions to the COVID-19 response, both in the private and public sector.\\r\\n\\r\\nKey workers deserve to be properly rewarded for the work they do. The Government has agreed specific pay and pension packages for a number of public sector workforces, including in the NHS, both to increase system capacity and recognise their work. More than one million NHS workers continue to benefit from the three-year Agenda for Change pay deal. The reforms will see the starting salary for a newly qualified nurse rise to £24,907 in 2020/21, 12.6% higher than 2017/18.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, the Government is supporting those at work through the package of measures it has announced to protect against the current economic emergency. This includes significant changes to the operation of statutory sick pay, universal credit, and employment and support allowance, so that people have quicker and more generous access to a support system. To support self-employed individuals affected by the coronavirus outbreak, the Government has also announced a new Self-Employed Income Support Scheme, alongside the deferral of income tax and VAT payments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe\\u202fGovernment is targeting support where it is most needed. A blanket tax holiday would be untargeted. Those paying higher rates of tax would receive the greatest benefit, while low-earning individuals\\u202fwith income below the personal allowance or the NICs primary threshold would not benefit. Furthermore, HMRC’s systems have not been designed to distinguish between key workers and non-key workers, and so the extension of this tax treatment to key workers would be vulnerable to exploitation and fraud by people who were not key workers and so not entitled to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe UK’s economic response to COVID-19 is one of the most generous and comprehensive in the world, and the Government is now working urgently to deliver these schemes as quickly as possible.  \\r\\n \\r\\nThe Government is also closely monitoring the impact of measures, having regard to the need to support public services, businesses, and individuals, and will continue to keep all policies under review. \\r\\n\\r\\nHM Treasury ',\n",

We have heard of truly shocking cases of vulnerable children being preyed upon by ruthless predators and failed by the state and those whose job it was to protect them. \\r\\n\\r\\nThese unthinkable crimes have had devastating impacts on towns and communities – leaving lasting scars that go beyond the direct victims, particularly where it has gone on for years. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis must never be allowed to happen again.

We must prevent the abuse of benefits and services, remove immigration offenders and foreign national offenders from the UK and disrupt the organised crime groups that prey on the vulnerable. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Immigration Rules already provide for undocumented migrants, who have not broken the law except for remaining here without lawful immigration status and have been in the UK for a long time, to regularise their status. This will remain the case when the new points-based immigration system is implemented. If appropriate in light of the situation in their country of origin, migrants may claim asylum or otherwise make an application for leave to remain where there are grounds to do so.  The Government will therefore not create a new earned amnesty route as requested by this petition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current private life Immigration Rules provide for an adult who: has lived continuously in the UK for at least 20 years; is aged between 18 and 25 years and has spent at least half of their life living here; or, has lived continuously in the UK for less than 20 years, but there would be very significant obstacles to their integration into the country of return; or, a child (under 18 years), who has lived continuously in the UK for 7 years where it would not be reasonable for them to leave; to remain in the UK. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlternatively, families can regularise their status under the family Immigration Rules where there is a qualifying partner or child (British or lived continuously in the UK for at least seven years) and it is unreasonable to expect family life to continue outside the UK or for the child to leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nA fee waiver is available for those who are destitute, at risk of destitution; or where there are welfare concerns for a child of a parent in receipt of a low income, or exceptional financial circumstances.  Additionally, the Home Office recognises the need to assist some of the more vulnerable members of our society and provided for exceptions to the need to pay application fees in a number of specific circumstances, for example, in relation to refugees and persons deriving rights under European law, and wider government policy (such as the protection of spouses from domestic abuse and the protection of vulnerable children).\\r\\n\\r\\nImmigration and Nationality (Fees) Regulations also include a discretionary waiver for those who are applying for leave to remain in the UK based on their European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) rights and can demonstrate they meet the relevant criteria.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor those who do not meet the requirements of these Rules, there is provision for a grant of leave where there are exceptional circumstances or compelling compassionate grounds which would mean refusal would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the applicant.

       "     'details': \"We know that social care will be at the frontline of our response to COVID-19 with social care providers looking after many of the most vulnerable in society. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Government is committed to ensuring that the NHS and social care system have the resources they need.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOVID-19 presents one of the most significant challenges our society has faced. The disease disproportionality affects those who are most vulnerable, and adult social care services are critical to the nation’s response.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe look to local authorities to continue to work with the health sector to ensure people are cared for in the most appropriate setting.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 19 March, the Government announced that £1.3bn would be made available to the NHS to cover care costs for those being discharged from hospital under new enhanced discharge arrangements.\\r\\nA further £1.6bn has been provided to councils to support the local response to COVID-19, of which we think the majority will need to be spent supporting social care services. This funding is being kept under review. The COVID-19 funding is in addition to the £1.5billion that councils have access to for adults and children’s social care in 2020-21, announced in the last Spending Review.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis includes an additional £1bn of grant funding for adults and children’s social care, and a proposed 2% precept that will enable councils to access a further £500 million for adult social care. \\r\\nThis £1.5 billion is on top of maintaining £2.5bn of existing social care grants and will support local authorities to meet rising demand and continue to stabilise the social care system.  \\r\\nFuture funding for social care will be set out at the next spending review.\\r\\nLocal authorities are responsible for commissioning social care services as they are best placed to understand and plan for the care needs of their populations, and to develop and build local market capacity. That is why under the Care Act 2014, local authorities are required to shape their local markets, and ensure that people have a range of high-quality, sustainable and person-centred care and support options available to them, and that they can access the services that best meet their needs. \\r\\nIn terms of the social care workforce, the Department is working closely with its delivery partner Skills for Care (SfC), to deliver structured support as the workforce adapts to the demands Covid-19 will pose to providers of our vital adult social care services. By mobilising SfC at the earliest opportunity we hope this will help assure the sector that DHSC is committed not only to supporting them respond to Covid-19, to recognise the contribution made by employees across this sector and also to continuing its ongoing commitments to helping train, develop and recruit a strong workforce for the future development of the sector.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are working with SfC to see how their strategic work programme can support local authorities and employers' response to covid-19 through enhanced training and resource, we have already made good progress on identifying the requirements for the sector and e-learning modules have been developed by their Endorsed Training Providers and are now available.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are supporting the Local Authority workforce through enabling temporary registration of social workers who have left the profession within 2 years – sent out a letter from Social Work England to 8200 retired social workers. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe recognise that during this time those working in the care sector will be feeling more anxious and under pressure. They will also feel a sense of duty to continue to provide a high-quality service for the people they care for. It is critical that the health and wellbeing of our caring sector is protected and we are working to ensure this happens.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe know that people who work in social care are providing a brilliant service, under difficult circumstances, and that being able to identify themselves as key workers, as well as receiving public support and recognition are really important. We know that care workers, as much as NHS staff, should benefit from priority access to supermarket shopping hours, and where they are not already, we are encouraging this to happen.\\r\\n \\r\\nPutting social care on a sustainable footing, where everyone is treated with dignity and respect, is one of the biggest challenges we face as a society.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\nAs the Prime Minister said, this government will deliver on its promises: we will bring forward a plan for social care this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are complex questions to address, which is why we have invited all MPs and Peers to voice their views, solutions and concerns about reforming the way that people pay for their care. We are currently considering how to best to take forward these cross-party talks in light of Government guidance on COVID-19.\\r\\n\\r\\nDepartment of Health and Social Care\",\n",

       "     'details': 'As the Prime Minister announced on 11 February, the Government has decided that HS2 will go ahead, alongside a revolution in local transport. With the right reforms in place, HS2 will become the spine of the country’s transport network, bringing our biggest cities closer together, boosting productivity and rebalancing opportunity fairly across the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Government’s decision to proceed follows careful consideration of Douglas Oakervee’s independent review into HS2, and wider evidence including the imminent Phase One full business case, environmental concerns, as well as a range of other views. This review was tasked with testing all the existing evidence on the project and considering, among other things: “how and whether to proceed” with HS2; its benefits and impacts; affordability and efficiency; deliverability; and strategic alternatives.  The project has therefore only recently been subject to a fundamental review.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Department understands the concerns raised by the public however, successive governments have affirmed their goal to invest in transport infrastructure to meet growing demand for north-south movement and to strategically rebalance the economy.  Both the 2013 Paving Act (which was not a hybrid Bill) and the 2017 Phase One Act received strong cross-party support.  This was particularly so in terms of the majorities that voted for the legislation.  This continues to be the case for the Phase 2a hybrid Bill as it makes its way through Parliament.  Only Parliament can repeal these Acts, and the recent High Court judgment in the case of Chris Packham CBE v Secretary of State for Transport, Prime Minister and HS2 Ltd, the court specifically noted that “there is a strong public interest in ensuring that, in a democracy, activities sanctioned by Parliament are not stopped by individuals merely because they do not personally agree with them.”  \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is also important to note that the Phase One Act sets out the specific requirements of the railway to be constructed, and the environmental minimum requirements that construction activities must comply with.  HS2 Ltd cannot deviate from these specifications and requirements without new powers being sought from Parliament.  An array of legally binding ‘Undertakings and Assurances’ made to organisations and individuals along the route, and effective monitoring arrangements to ensure HS2 Ltd compliance, mean that HS2 Ltd will deliver the railway as specified by Parliament and also construct it in the way specified by Parliament.   \\r\\n\\r\\nIn setting out the decision to proceed with HS2, the Prime Minister made a clear commitment to drawing a line under past problems of transparency and cost control on HS2, and a recognition that going forward, things must change. The Department is improving discipline and oversight with a full-time dedicated HS2 minister who will take part in monthly cross-government meetings, similar to the delivery of the 2012 Olympics, and provide regular updates to Parliament on progress. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Department has now published its Full Business Case for Phase One, which underpins the decision to authorise ‘Notice to Proceed’ and allow construction of Phase One to commence.  The Phase One Full Business Case sets out the rationale for the first part of the HS2 scheme between the West Midlands and London. It can be found on the following link.\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hs2-phase-one-full-business-case\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite Doug Oakervee’s recommendation of reducing the frequency assumption for HS2 to 14tph, the Government has maintained its existing service planning assumption (in the Business Case) of 17tph concluding that there are benefits of running a high-frequency service as it affords the Government the flexibility to serve more destinations in the future supporting the Government’s agenda to level-up regional economies.  In any event, precise service patterns and speeds were not specified in the Phase One Act and are a matter for the service operator once HS2 is operational.\\r\\n\\r\\nHS2 will spread prosperity and productivity across the whole country, bringing our great cities closer together and forming the spine of our nation’s transport network. The upcoming business case will show that these benefits continue to outweigh the project’s costs. \\r\\n\\r\\nDepartment for Transport',\n",

       "     'summary': 'The Government considers that prohibition on the four types of fighting dog under Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 should remain in place. This is supported by police who are responsible for enforcing the Act.',\n",
       "     'details': 'The law on dangerous dogs is concerned with protecting the safety of the public. The four types of dog, pit bull terrier, Japanese Tosa, Dogo Argentino and Fila Brasileiro are prohibited because they are types bred for fighting. The Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 states that no person shall give away, breed or breed from, sell, or exchange a prohibited dog. However, the law allows a person to keep an individual dog where a court has considered that it does not present a danger to public safety. The court must consider the temperament of the dog and whether the intended keeper is a “fit and proper person” and other matters such as suitability of accommodation. Dogs placed on the Index of Exempted dogs may be kept by the owner under strict conditions, including that the dog is neutered, microchipped and kept on a lead and muzzled in public. There are currently around 3,000 dogs where a court has granted an exemption and allowed them to stay with their owner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 also makes it an offence to allow a dog of any breed or type to become dangerously out of control in any place. The maximum penalty for this offence is 14 years imprisonment, where the offence has led to a death and 5 years imprisonment where someone is injured.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnforcers are able to take action before dog attacks happen. The Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 includes specific measures to enable the police and local authorities to tackle irresponsible dog ownership before a dog attack occurs. Practitioners can intervene at an early stage to help to prevent situations involving irresponsible owners of dogs from becoming serious. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2014 Act includes streamlined measures to tackle anti-social behaviour, including where such behaviour involves a dog. The main tool to combat this form of irresponsible dog ownership is the Community Protection Notice (CPN). CPNs can be issued by local authority officers or the police on dog owners, or anyone temporarily in charge of a dog at the time of an incident, where dogs are behaving in an unruly way. The CPN could require the dog’s owner, or the person in charge of it, to take appropriate action to prevent a reoccurrence of the offending behaviour. To breach a CPN is a criminal offence and could lead to a significant penalty. The Government is determined to crack down on irresponsible dog ownership and to that end we are encouraging police forces across the country to use these new tools.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, Defra has commissioned further research in collaboration with Middlesex University to look at responsible ownership across all breeds of dog. The research will consider different approaches and the effectiveness of current dog control measures. The research will also seek to identify and examine the factors and situations that may cause dog attacks; how to promote responsible dog ownership.  We expect to have a final report by the end of 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are no proposals to re-introduce the dog licence. The previous licensing scheme for dogs was ceased in 1988 because it was estimated that only around 40% of owners were compliant. This is similar to compliance levels in countries that still operate a dog licensing scheme.\\r\\n\\r\\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs',\n",

       "     'summary': 'HE providers must deliver high quality courses.\\r\\nIf students are unhappy they should first complain to their provider and if their concerns are unresolved they can ask OIA to consider their complaint.',\n",
       "     'details': 'Government recognises the challenges facing students and supports them in their desire to continue receiving the best possible learning experience from our higher education (HE) providers. We consider it in the best interests of all students that they receive a high-quality online education during this unprecedented period that allows them to progress and to complete their studies within the time period they had been anticipating.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some fantastic and innovative examples of high-quality online learning being delivered by HE providers across the country, and the sector is working hard to provide and prepare learning materials for the summer and autumn terms. Universities are autonomous and responsible for setting their own fees. In deciding to keep charging full fees, universities will of course want to ensure that they can continue to deliver courses which are fit for purpose and help students progress their qualifications. Any refund is a matter for universities, so we are not considering a write off of tuition fee loans.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe believe that students should be at the heart of the HE system. The Office for Students (OfS), the regulator in England, has committed to protecting students throughout the present crisis and has published guidance for registered providers on how it will approach the regulation of quality and standards, and this includes practical ways in which students can complete their studies whilst ensuring quality and standards are upheld. Providers are already making these arrangements and the Government is in continuous contact with the sector to support the continuation of teaching and assessment. The Government is also working closely with the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education to ensure students continue to leave HE with qualifications that have real value, reflect their hard work and allow people to progress. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Government’s clear expectation is that HE providers should make all reasonable efforts to enable students to complete their studies. If providers are unable to facilitate good online tuition, they should seek to avoid charging students for any additional terms they may need to undergo as a consequence – avoiding effectively charging them twice. Whether or not an individual student is entitled to a refund of fees will depend on the specific contractual arrangements between the provider and student. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is important that students continue to receive a good standard of education, and they are entitled to make a complaint if they feel that their HE provider has not taken sufficient steps to appropriately respond to this situation. In the first instance, students should speak to their provider to see if they can resolve their complaint. We expect student complaints and appeals processes to be operated flexibly, accessibly, and sympathetically by providers to resolve any concerns. If a student at a provider in England or Wales is not satisfied with their provider’s response, they can ask the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education (OIA) to consider their complaint. \\r\\n\\r\\nGovernment also understands that it may be difficult for some students to finish their current year of study for personal reasons, and that this will undoubtedly be a source of concern to many. Where students are unable to complete their current year of study or need to repeat a year due to compelling personal reasons, they may be eligible for an additional year of fee loan support above their standard entitlement under existing arrangements. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, Government appreciates the difficult situation facing students who are renting term-time accommodation. We encourage universities and private hall providers to be fair in their decisions about rent charges for this period. A number of large companies have waived rents for the summer term or released students early from their contracts. Students who are tenants with individual private landlords should discuss the possibility of an early release from their tenancy agreement. The Government has also worked with the OfS so that existing funds, totalling £46m across April and May, can now be used to boost providers’ hardship funds for students in financial difficulty. This can include help for IT equipment and internet access, and may be helpful for students who are struggling with housing costs or loss of income from part-time work.\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernment has previously responded to a petition concerning compensation for strike action at universities. The response to this petition can be found here: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/300528 \\r\\n\\r\\nDepartment for Education \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a revised response.

       "     'details': 'The law of trespass is largely one of common law, with the courts developing the law and resolving disputes based on the circumstances of the case. However, following the ‘Powers for Dealing with Unauthorised Development and Encampments’ consultation in 2018, it was clear that action is needed to address the sense of unease and intimidation residents feel when an unauthorised encampment occurs: the frustration at not being able to access amenities, public land and business premises; and the waste and cost that is left once the encampment has moved on. There is a need to strengthen police powers, in particular powers to tackle unauthorised encampments. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result, the Government launched a consultation in 2019 to seek views on how the act of trespass, when setting up or residing on an unauthorised encampment could be criminalised, or whether it is preferable to extend the current police powers to direct people away from unauthorised sites. Such measures would not affect ramblers, the right to roam or rights of way. Instead, measures could be applied in specific circumstances relating to trespass with intent to reside. The current Home Office consultation sets out a number of options for consideration, including trespass legislation such as that which has existed in the Republic of Ireland since 2002. This legislation provides for an offence where the trespasser is likely to ‘substantially damage’ the land or interfere with it; the police may direct trespassers to leave and failure to comply with that direction is an offence. Trespass is also a criminal offence in Scotland. The Trespass (Scotland) Act specifically excludes the exercise of recreational/roaming access rights.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAll of these issues will be carefully considered as part of the consultation process. Responses to the consultation are currently being reviewed and a Government response will be issues in due course.\\r\\n\\r\\nMinistry of Justice',\n",

       "     'summary': 'The Government is providing comprehensive support to individuals and households impacted by Covid-19, including a £500 million hardship fund for those in receipt of working age council tax support.',\n",
       "     'details': 'The Covid-19 outbreak has far-reaching consequences beyond public health. The Government has therefore put in place an unprecedented package of support for individuals and households affected by the outbreak.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe assistance that the Government is providing is targeted to protect those most at financial risk due to the impact of Covid-19 on the economy. It includes a wide range of support mechanisms to protect people’s incomes during the Covid-19 outbreak. The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme helps firms to continue to keep people in employment through cash grants totalling 80% of employees’ wages, up to a monthly cap of £2,500. The scheme will be open initially for at least 3 months and will be extended for longer if necessary.  Similar support is also being provided to those who are self-employed, or partners in businesses, through the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme. Those eligible for this scheme can be paid grants worth 80% of their trading profits, up to a maximum of £2,500 per month.  \\r\\n\\r\\nProtections have also been put in place for homeowners and renters experiencing financial difficulty due to COVID-19. Following discussions with the industry, mortgage lenders are offering a three-month payment holiday for affected homeowners and landlords whose tenants are experiencing payment difficulty.  Through the Coronavirus Act 2020, we have legislated to delay when landlords are able to evict tenants. Landlords cannot start proceedings to evict tenants for a three month period and the court service has suspended all ongoing housing possession action for 90 days from 27 March. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo support those on low incomes through the outbreak, the Chancellor has also announced a package of temporary benefit measures. The Government has increased the standard allowance of Working Tax Credit and Universal Credit by £20 a week. There has also been an increase in the Local Housing Allowance rates for private renters claiming Universal Credit housing element or Housing Benefit so they are set at the 30th percentile of market rents. Self-employed workers whose income has been affected by Covid-19 will also see their Minimum Income Floors relaxed further, so that their Universal Credit award can be increased to reflect their lower earnings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Government has also moved rapidly to provide a £500 million hardship fund to local authorities in England. Our expectation is that local authorities will use the majority of this fund to provide council tax reductions to economically vulnerable people and households, with a focus on working age recipients of Council Tax Support. \\r\\nMany councils are also applying local level discretion in their approach to council tax collection, including the opportunity for individuals to set up flexible payment plans and suspension of enforcement action. Individuals whose income has been affected by Covid-19 can check their eligibility for Local Council Tax Support schemes or flexible approaches to payment by getting in touch with their councils. \\r\\nPeople who can afford to pay council tax should continue to do so to ensure that services, including social care for the elderly, can continue to be provided in these unprecedented times.  The Government does not consider that a general council tax holiday would be appropriate.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more information about measures to support individuals and businesses affected by Covid-19, please see https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-those-affected-by-covid-19 and https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19/covid-19-support-for-businesses. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd for information on measures and guidance for local government, please see https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-local-government#local-government. \\r\\n\\r\\nMinistry of Housing Communities and Local Government',\n",

       "     'details': 'Hard-working parents across the country rely on childcare to help them balance their home and work commitments. We can rightly be proud of our childcare sector. 96% of childcare settings in England are now rated good or outstanding by Ofsted, an increase from 74% in 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the current Coronavirus outbreak, the Government wants to support nurseries, pre-schools and childminders during what must be a worrying and uncertain time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have asked childcare providers to continue to provide care for a limited number of children - children who are vulnerable, and children whose parents are critical to the coronavirus (COVID-19) response and cannot be safely cared for at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo help them do this, we have taken steps to directly support childcare providers in the current crisis.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe currently fund local authorities (LAs) to pay early education providers to offer up to 30 hours of early education per week, to qualifying families, for two, three and four-year-old children. We announced on 17 March that we will continue to pay this funding to LAs, which will provide reassurance for early years settings. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have also put in place a significant package of financial support including a business rate holiday for many private providers and the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme to support workers. We expect nurseries to take a reasonable and proportionate approach to parents’ fees, in light of these unprecedented circumstances, and to communicate any arrangements clearly with them\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, childcare providers will benefit from the additional range of financial assistance measures we have introduced to support workers and businesses at this time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have announced that childcare providers will be eligible for a business rates holiday for one year. That means non-local authority providers of childcare (registered with Ofsted and providing EYFS) will pay no business rates in 2020 to 2021, from 1 April. This includes nurseries which are eligible for a charitable status relief – they will also pay no business rates at all in 2020-21 – and nurseries in receipt of small business rate relief or rural rate relief will benefit from small business grant funding of £10,000 (we also know that some settings operate from shared spaces which may now benefit from a 100% rates relief – and we strongly encourage those shared spaces to reflect any business rates saving in their rent charges).\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have also set up schemes to help employees and the self-employed, during the outbreak – which will benefit both providers and parents. The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme means that for employees who are not working but kept on payroll, the Government will contribute 80% of each worker’s wages of up to £2,500, backdated to 1 March 2020. Businesses can access this scheme while continuing to be paid the early entitlements funding via local authorities. The self-employed may be eligible for taxable grants under the Government’s Coronavirus (COVID-19) Self-employment Income Support Scheme, announced on 26 March. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe thank the nurseries and other childcare providers who are working so hard to care for the children of critical workers and vulnerable children. This is a vital part of our fight against Coronavirus. In turn, we are working hard to mitigate the impacts of Coronavirus on all parts of our society. In the light of the steps we have already taken, we urge all childcare providers to be reasonable and balanced in their dealings with parents, given the great uncertainty they will be facing too.  We are keeping under very close review what further support individuals and businesses may require.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther information relating to setting closures, plus the full range of support available for workers and businesses can be found here:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures#funding\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19/covid-19-support-for-businesses\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-a-grant-through-the-coronavirus-covid-19-self-employment-income-support-scheme\\r\\n\\r\\nDepartment for Education\\r\\n',\n",

       "     'details': 'The Government is committed to building a digitally inclusive society, and aims to ensure that COVID-19 media announcements are accessible for all UK audiences. As broadcasters are independent from the Government, they are responsible for their signing resources and for meeting statutory accessibility requirements set out by Ofcom.\\r\\n\\r\\nSocial distancing rules may make it harder for broadcasters to provide appropriate signing resources. However, the Government continues to engage with broadcasters on developing accessibility provisions that are in line with the Government’s social distancing guidelines.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn line with Public Health England (PHE) guidelines, it is not possible to safely include a physical British Sign Language (BSL) interpreter in the room for daily briefings as this would require additional operations staff such as an additional cameraman to be present. At Downing Street the Government is working within the constraints of a historical site with limited space. \\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone in government continues to practice social distancing, which means staying two metres apart where possible, and journalists are currently attending the daily briefings remotely rather than in person in order to prevent unnecessary risk. Having an interpreter physically attend, along with any additional staff required to facilitate broadcast of the interpretation, contradicts the PHE guidelines, and potentially puts them and others at risk.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor these reasons the Government believes that it is right to limit the number of people present in the daily briefings to protect all those who must be present from additional risks.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, it is vital that that public health information reaches everyone across the country, which is why BSL interpretation of the daily Covid briefings is now provided via the BBC News channel and iPlayer, which are available on a wide range of platforms – including satellite and cable services, as well as Freeview and over the internet. The Government continues to engage with broadcasters to ensure greater replication of this ‘remote’ signed interpretation across a wider range of media channels.\\r\\n\\r\\nITV’s bespoke Sign Language studio, SignPost, is also offering content for the deaf community online, with a daily online news bulletin produced remotely from presenters’ houses. This has a BSL interpreter covering all of the latest news regarding Covid. The Government will continue to engage with broadcasters about including signing provisions in future announcements to ensure that information is accessible.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn wider programming signing requirements, Ofcom, as the independent broadcast regulator, enforces statutory targets for the amount of signing that eligible broadcasters, including BBC, ITV, Channel 4, and Channel 5, have to provide. It is up to the broadcasters to determine which programmes they select for signing. Ofcom encourages all broadcasters to go beyond their statutory requirements through best practice guidelines. These provide guidance for broadcasters on selecting programmes, advising that broadcasters should give priority to the most popular programmes and a broad range of programmes.

       "     'details': 'The Government’s priority is to do whatever is necessary to protect the NHS and save lives. The Ministry of Justice is equally determined to protect those who live and work in prisons from harm and ensure the stability of our jails.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPublic Health England has advised that without action, coronavirus could spread rapidly in prisons due to the close proximity in which prisoners live, overwhelming local NHS services and putting the lives of prisoners, staff and people outside the prison system at risk. It is for these reasons, and in response to the current unprecedented emergency, that on Saturday 4 April, the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice announced that carefully risk-assessed prisoners, who are already within two months of their release date will be temporarily released from prison.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPrisoners who pass the criteria for release will be subject to strict conditions, and will be electronically monitored, including with GPS tags, to enforce the requirement to stay at home. They can be immediately recalled to prison for breaching these conditions or committing further offences. The releases will be phased over time but can start from the week commencing 6 April.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Government has also previously announced that pregnant women in custody who do not pose a high risk of harm to the public will be temporarily released from prison to protect them and their unborn children from coronavirus. Prisoners in Mother and Baby Units meeting the same risk assessment will also be released with their children. \\r\\n \\r\\nPublic protection is paramount, and therefore no high-risk offenders, including those convicted of violent or sexual offences, anyone of national security concern or a danger to children, will be considered for release, nor any prisoners who have not served at least half of their custodial term. Additionally, no offenders convicted of COVID-19 related offences, including coughing at emergency workers or stealing personal protective equipment, will be eligible. No prisoner would be released if they have symptoms of coronavirus or without housing and health support being in place.\\r\\n \\r\\nWe do not take this decision, or our duty of care to prisoners and staff, lightly. Alongside this we are also working to identify publicly owned sites that could be used to house temporary prison accommodation to ease pressure on the permanent estate, and allow us to further separate prisoners and reduce the spread of the virus. We are also working with the judiciary to expedite sentencing hearings for those on remand to reduce the numbers being held in custody. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere will be some vulnerable prisoners who will not be suitable for release owing to the risk they pose to the public, and to protect them we have provided guidance to prisons on measures to take to shield vulnerable people.  This includes the creation of shielding units, which are a specific part of a prison designated to house those required to socially shield themselves. \\r\\n\\r\\nMinistry of Justice.',\n",

       "     'details': 'The Coronavirus is the biggest threat this country has faced in decades – and this country is not alone. All over the world we are seeing the devastating impact of this invisible killer. Our approach to tackling coronavirus is driven by the latest scientific and medical advice. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 17 March 2020, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office advised against all non-essential international travel, and the UK Government introduced unprecedented measures to manage and contain the spread of the virus. These measures include staying at home and away from others, and self-isolation. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn line with that advice to date, no changes have been required at the UK border. This will be kept under regular review, but at present the current border arrangements are not seen as having an impact on the spread of the virus.  Instead, changes could have a negative impact on the continued flow of critical goods including food, medicines and medical supplies that are vital for the whole of the UK. We are working to make sure that a network of infrastructure remains in place across the UK to continue to deliver these services.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational and domestic freight transport (including by air, ship, road and rail, including roll-on/roll-off transports) is classified by UK Government as an essential activity. The essential flow of critical goods includes medicines, medical devices (such as ventilators), food and chemicals critical for water and energy. Port, airport workers and many others within these complex supply chains are key workers and perform an important role in helping the UK to respond to the unprecedented situation presented by the corona virus. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Channel Tunnel is a critical connection and plays a key role in the movement of a range of important goods, such as fresh produce, high-value manufacturing and just-in-time goods. Eurotunnel shuttles continue to fully operate to keep the critical goods transported through the Tunnel moving.  Measures have been put in place to enable social distancing and safeguard health.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Government recognises the importance of maintaining the health and safety of key workers. Freight operators continue to implement the latest health and safety measures, including social distancing both at borders and during crossings. The Government is reminding Eurotunnel of its health and safety responsibilities and the importance of enabling social distance measures, both at the UK and French terminals, and also during crossings through the Channel Tunnel.\\r\\n\\r\\nFerry and lifeline operators provide critical passenger and freight services across the UK and other European countries. These operators ensure that essential goods continue to arrive into our country. This helps to protect our economy, and connect remote UK communities to essential services, ensuring their survival. The Government is aware of the major impact that COVID-19 is having on all these operators, and continues to work closely with the sector to understand how the measures announced by the Chancellor and the Bank of England can be applied. \\r\\n\\r\\nYou can read more about Governments advice for the freight transport industry here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-freight-transport\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can read more about the Governments latest travel advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office here: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-advice-novel-coronavirus\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this difficult time for the country, we recognise the extreme disruption the necessary actions are having on people’s lives, their businesses, their jobs and the nation’s economy. The Government is asking everyone to stay at home – unless for one of the reasons that have been set out.\\r\\n\\r\\nDepartment for Transport',\n",

It is important that we have a system in place for making evidence-based decisions on whether new medicines should be routinely funded by the NHS, based on their clinical and cost effectiveness. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is the independent body that makes recommendations on whether new drugs work well enough to justify the cost to the NHS. NHS commissioners are legally required to fund medicines recommended in NICE technology appraisal guidance.  Many thousands of patients have benefitted from access to effective treatments as a result of NICE’s guidance.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2018, the then Secretary of State asked NICE to develop guidance on whether Kuvan represents a clinically and cost-effective use of NHS resources and should, therefore, be made routinely available to patients. These are very difficult decisions to make and it is right that they are made independently based on an assessment of the evidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nNICE’s appraisal was unfortunately suspended as the manufacturer of Kuvan, BioMarin, withdrew from the process.  However, I am pleased that BioMarin has now agreed to re-engage in the appraisal and NICE will now aim to publish guidance on Kuvan as soon as possible.
