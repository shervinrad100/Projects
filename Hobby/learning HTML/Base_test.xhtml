            Since we have specified a base URL, the browser will look for the image "html5.gif" at "https://www.w3schools.com/images/html5.gif"
        </p>
        <img src="html5.gif" />
        <p>
            Also, having the target set to "_blank" will open all the hyperlinks in a new tab without repeating the target for every link:
            <a href="https://www.google.com/"> Google </a>
