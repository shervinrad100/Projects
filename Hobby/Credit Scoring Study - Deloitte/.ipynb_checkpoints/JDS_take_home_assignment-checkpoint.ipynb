    "__Requirements__: \n",
    "1. You have __7days__ to return the assignment. \n",
    "2. Use python for all Assignments and (when asked for) `sqlalchemy` or any other package of your choice to integrate `SQL` to this notebook for data transformations (you can use pandas or any other package if the problem does not ask for `sqlalchemy`)\n",
    "3. For visualizations, please use python (common libraries)\n",

    "__Deliverables__: \n",
    "1. Python Jupyter notebook with your code. Add comments to the code !!!! Comments let us follow your thought process. \n",
