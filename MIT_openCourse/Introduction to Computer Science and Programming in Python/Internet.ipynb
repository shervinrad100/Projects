    "# How the internet works\n",
    "\n",
    "Most basic network system is a **Local Area Network (LAN)** and there are 2 parts to it:\n",
    "- ethernet: sends/receives data from hub  \n",
    "- hub: shares all the data received by one device to all devices \n",
    "\n",
    "**Network bridges** connect multiple hubs and it only sends the data when its requested by the host; so it doesnt share all the information with all the hosts at all time. You search, you get.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different lans speak different languages and **routers** make the LANs communicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you connect different LAN networks using routers it turns into a **Wide Area Network (WAN)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Transmission Communication Protocol (TCP)/ Internet Protocol IP** is a language/ communication standard for all devices to be able to communicate through a router. \n",
    "\n",
    "TCP is a standard on how one computer sends data to another. Data is transmitted in datagrams/bits and it needs to have an address which it goes to and that is the IP.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Domain Names** is human readable address that translates to an IP address.\n",
    "- First level: .com, .gov, .edu\n",
    "- Second level: .google., .facebook., .amazon.\n",
    "- Third level: maps., shop., news. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Domain Naming System** maps all the domain names to an IP address and translates the human readable domain and vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Client/Server or request response model\n",
    " Someone has to ask for something for HTTP to respond. Here the client is you and the server is youtube, google, amazon etc\n",
    " \n",
    "2. Stateless protocol\n",
    " It's like independent events in probability context. However,  the web applications track your state using sessions, cookies, etc\n",
    " \n",
    "3. Application layer protocol\n",
    " below it is the TCP transportation level protocol. This is basically abstraction. It doesnt care about how data is sent so it cares about sending a request and getting data back.\n",
    " \n",
    "4. Client actions\n",
    " When a client requests something, it always specifies an action/method such as get, post, delete, etc and these are actions to be performed by the server.\n",
    " - get: requests to see a page and is read only\n",
    " - post: create something new on that page\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Server status code\n",
    "the HTTP protocol standardises the responses the servers give. \n",
    " - 200: ok\n",
    " - 404: not found\n",
    " - 500: you fucked up\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Headers\n",
    " small bits of information which you send along with your request/responses to tweak your request/response. So this for example you specify which type of data you are requesting (content type). <br>\n",
    "A client header sounds like: get text file, the request will recognise that and respond with a txt.<br>\n",
    "Response header might also include the status codes.  \n",
    " - content type: txt, png, etc\n",
    " - cache control\n",
    "\n",
    "HyperText Markup Language (HTML)\n",
    "ctrl + U\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sessions & Cookies\n",
    "\n",
    "The client usually has a stateless interaction with the server over HTTP. So what the server does is that it _gives you_ a **cookie**, an id which you carry with you, which identifies you; they also save the data of your previous interactions in a **session**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some applications may decide to save the sessions on the client side (different to convention). This speeds up the process because then you don't have to present the cookie which then the server looks up and retrieves your session. "
